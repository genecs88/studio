# **App Name**: EnvKey Manager

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Secure user authentication.
- Admin Management: Admin page to add/update/delete Organization, API Key, and Environment fields.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) which translates to a vibrant blue (#3399FF) to represent trust and security.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 15%) which is a dark desaturated blue (#1A2633) to provide a professional, secure feel, supporting a dark theme.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 60%) which is a bright cyan (#4DD9D9) used for interactive elements, providing a clear visual distinction.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a modern and readable interface, and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to add a techy feel.
- Use clean, minimalist icons that represent the different environments (e.g., a cloud for production, gears for development). Color-code icons to match the accent color scheme.
- Employ a clear, tab-based layout for easy navigation between organizations, API keys, and environments. Prioritize data security by using masked input fields for sensitive information.
- Subtle transitions and animations to indicate state changes and feedback (e.g., a loading animation when generating a key, a slide-in notification for successful actions).
